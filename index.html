            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.polisci.pitt.edu/">Department of Political Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a>. 
              I specialize in international relations with a focus on civil war, rebel governance, and post-conflict peacebuilding.

              My work explains how rebel governance and different types of governance affect the durability of peace after conflict. 
              I use a variety of methods to explore these issues, including cross-national statistical analysis and case studies.

              <h4> Dissertation Project </h4> 
              <h5> What explains a variation in the fates of post-conflict countries? 
                Why do some societies emerge from civil wars and successfully establish peaceful and functioning states while others are mired in conflict traps? 
                My dissertation focuses on war-time governance activities that rebel groups engage in to understand the variations in post-civil war trajectory.
                I argue that wartime rebel governance contributes to durable peace after war through rebel political participation. 
                However, not all types of rebel governance are created equal. For example, there is significant variance in the extent to which rebel governance includes participatory political arrangements. Some rebel groups largely allow civilian participation in governance during the war while others exclude civilians.
                While rebel governance, in general, may increase the durability of post-war peace, its stabilizing effects vary depending on how much civilians participate in rebel governance. 
                First, participatory rebel governance influences the capability of rebel groups to become viable political players after war. The implementation of participatory governance depends on voluntary and continuous cooperation with the civilian population. 
                Rebels that secure voluntary support during the war can better mobilize electoral support after war, which can failitate post-conflict political particpation of rebel groups. Moreover, peace after civil wars is expected to be particularly durable when rebel groups develop participatory governance during the war by promoting civil political participation.
                Using a mixed-method approach by employing both quantitative and qualitative methods, my dissertation underscores rebel governance, especially participatory governance, in the post-conflict peace process.   </h5>
